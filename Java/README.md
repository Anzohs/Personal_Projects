<h1>A recriation of the game Pong in a GameDev Library called LibGDX <h1>


## Demo


I decided to embrace an Online Course HarvardX: [CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://www.edx.org/learn/game-development/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-game-development?index=product&queryID=7ed1f919c5ccb9ea78e4b1d2f8140f32&position=1&results_level=first-level-results&term=Game+Dev&objectID=course-8d1da557-03db-4175-b881-e0480d706d96&campaign=CS50%27s+Introduction+to+Game+Development&source=edX&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fsearch)

Instead of doing in Lua(Language used in the Course), I decide to recreate the games and challanges in Java with LibGDX</p>
